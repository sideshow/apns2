# APNS/2

APNS/2 is a go package designed for simple, flexible and fast Apple Push Notifications on iOS, OSX and Safari using the new HTTP/2 Push provider API.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sideshow/apns2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sideshow/apns2)  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/sideshow/apns2/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/sideshow/apns2?branch=master)  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/sideshow/apns2?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/sideshow/apns2)

## Features

- Uses new Apple APNs HTTP/2 connection
- Works with go 1.6 and later
- Supports new iOS 10 features such as Collapse IDs, Subtitles and Mutable Notifications
- Supports persistent connections to APNs
- Supports VoIP/PushKit notifications (iOS 8 and later)
- Fast, modular & easy to use
- Tested and working in APNs production environment

## Install

- Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed and have set your [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).
- Install apns2:

```sh
go get -u github.com/sideshow/apns2
```

If you are running the test suite you will also need to install testify:
```sh
go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify
```

## Example

```go
package main

import (
  "log"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/sideshow/apns2"
  "github.com/sideshow/apns2/certificate"
)

func main() {

  cert, err := certificate.FromP12File("../cert.p12", "")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Cert Error:", err)
  }

  notification := &apns2.Notification{}
  notification.DeviceToken = "11aa01229f15f0f0c52029d8cf8cd0aeaf2365fe4cebc4af26cd6d76b7919ef7"
  notification.Topic = "com.sideshow.Apns2"
  notification.Payload = []byte(`{"aps":{"alert":"Hello!"}}`) // See Payload section below

  client := apns2.NewClient(cert).Production()
  res, err := client.Push(notification)

  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error:", err)
  }

  fmt.Printf("%v %v %v\n", res.StatusCode, res.ApnsID, res.Reason)
}
```

## Notification

At a minimum, a _Notification_ needs a _DeviceToken_, a _Topic_ and a _Payload_.

```go
notification := &apns2.Notification{
  DeviceToken: "11aa01229f15f0f0c52029d8cf8cd0aeaf2365fe4cebc4af26cd6d76b7919ef7",
  Topic: "com.sideshow.Apns2",
  Payload: []byte(`{"aps":{"alert":"Hello!"}}`),
}
```

You can also set an optional _ApnsID_, _Expiration_ or _Priority_.

```go
notification.ApnsID =  "40636A2C-C093-493E-936A-2A4333C06DEA"
notification.Expiration = time.Now()
notification.Priority = apns2.PriorityLow
```

## Payload

You can use raw bytes for the `notification.Payload` as above, or you can use the payload builder package which makes it easy to construct APNs payloads.

```go
// {"aps":{"alert":"hello","badge":1},"key":"val"}

payload := apns2.NewPayload().Alert("hello").Badge(1).Custom("key", "val")

notification.Payload = payload
client.Push(notification)
```

Refer to the [payload](https://godoc.org/github.com/sideshow/apns2/payload) docs for more info.

## Response, Error handling

APNS/2 draws the distinction between a valid response from Apple indicating whether or not the _Notification_ was sent or not, and an unrecoverable or unexpected _Error_;

- An `Error` is returned if a non-recoverable error occurs, i.e. if there is a problem with the underlying _http.Client_ connection or _Certificate_, the payload was not sent, or a valid _Response_ was not received.
- A `Response` is returned if the payload was successfully sent to Apple and a documented response was received. This struct will contain more information about whether or not the push notification succeeded, its _apns-id_ and if applicable, more information around why it did not succeed.

To check if a `Notification` was successfully sent;

```go
res, err := client.Push(notification)
if err != nil {
  log.Println("There was an error", err)
  return
}

if res.Sent() {
  log.Println("Sent:", res.ApnsID)
} else {
  fmt.Printf("Not Sent: %v %v %v\n", res.StatusCode, res.ApnsID, res.Reason)
}
```

## Context & Timeouts

For better control over request cancelations and timeouts APNS/2 supports
contexts. Using a context can be helpful if you want to cancel all pushes when
the parent process is cancelled, or need finer grained control over individual
push timeouts. See the [Google post](https://blog.golang.org/context) for more
information on contexts.

```go
ctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10 * time.Second)
res, err := client.PushWithContext(ctx, notification)
defer cancel()
```

## Command line tool

APNS/2 has a command line tool that can be installed with `go get github.com/sideshow/apns2/apns2`. Usage:

```
apns2 --help
usage: apns2 --certificate-path=CERTIFICATE-PATH --topic=TOPIC [<flags>]

Listens to STDIN to send notifications and writes APNS response code and reason to STDOUT.

The expected format is: <DeviceToken> <APNS Payload>
Example: aff0c63d9eaa63ad161bafee732d5bc2c31f66d552054718ff19ce314371e5d0 {"aps": {"alert": "hi"}}
Flags:
      --help               Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
  -c, --certificate-path=CERTIFICATE-PATH
                           Path to certificate file.
  -t, --topic=TOPIC        The topic of the remote notification, which is typically the bundle ID for your app
  -m, --mode="production"  APNS server to send notifications to. `production` or `development`. Defaults to `production`
      --version            Show application version.
```
